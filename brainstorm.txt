Session tokens:
- need to update lobby fields on socket change
- do we need the addresses in lobby?
	- can have them in lobby manager? lobby sends lobby manager message, which sends to both players
	- bottleneck at lobby manager
- updating the existing fields:
	- if a client connection is closed, client connection manager still has state of the old connection
		- we can call stop on the connection actor
		- actor will be stopped, but can still be accessed in client connection manager
		- need to garbage collect maybe?
	- on new socket connection, client connection manager updates new connection fields as needed from old one
		- eg. lobby address
	- client connection manager sends message to lobby (update user connection)

ClientConnectionManager:
- map session tokens <> client connection address

ClientConnection:
- addr: lobby

Lobby:
- addr: user1 connection
- addr: user2 connection


Messages:
ClientMessage: used by ClientConnection to model messages received from client
ServerMessage: used by ClientConnection to model messages to be sent from server
Lobby

API:
POST ws::/connect
	- optional session_token
	- sends session_token back on connection

Websocket server messages
- Move made
	- probably should include side
- Game started
- Game ended (result)
- Rematch?

Websocket client messages
- Create lobby
	- Choosing sides?
	- Time control?
- Join lobby
- Start lobby
- Make move
	- should include side?
- Forfeit
- Rematch

*Everything except initial connection will be via websocket
	- will need some infrastructure around keeping socket alive (probably FE task?)


ClientConnection: Websocket implementation for client connection
ClientConnectionManager: actor for controlling to websocket events
LobbyManager: actor for controlling lobby events


Actor Model:
- LobbyManager
	- lobby ids map
- ClientConnection
	- Session token -> connection map
	- session token -> lobby id map

Client socket receives user message
-> send to lobby manager actor
-> perform lobby action
-> send message to client socket actor
-> send message to client
